AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## ‚úîÔ∏è <span style="color:#FFD23F">Acceptable Criteria</span>

- GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
- WHEN I load the portfolio THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
- WHEN I view the header THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
- WHEN I view the navigation titles THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
- WHEN I click on a navigation title THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
- WHEN I load the portfolio the first time THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
- WHEN I am presented with the About Me section THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
